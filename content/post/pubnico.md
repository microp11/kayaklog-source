### Day 1 Pubnico, Argyler

Ebbing: 1h after HW at Yarmouth starts building up, the wave forms 3-3.5h after HW, rule of 12s and 50/90 flow.

On LAND we had a 15 minutes discussion on the rules of engagement for LTS "Student focused learning":

-   be prepared
-   personal safety
-   your kit
-   your paddle
-   proper footwear
-   shuttle with trailer and truck
-   kit at the end of the paddle
-   humidity in maritime environment
-   mark your equipment
-   what to bring

In FLAT WATER:

-   connectivity
-   power transfer
-   active forward lean
-   turns, outer and inner edge
-   consistent edging
-   looking for where you want to go
-   fully immersed blade
-   situations when you have to lean back in your kayak:
    -   when surfing to adjust the center of weight
    -   when emptying another boat to look underneath
    -   ?
-   around a buoy, inner edge turn:
    -   fwd, fwd, fwd, fwd, fwd, sweep, bow rudder, high recovery, bow draw
-   lateral movement, draw stroke while crossing

In MOVING WATER:

-   crossing the eddy line, crossing the jet
    -   momentum
    -   edge
    -   angle of attack
    -   purposeful fwd lean
-   forwards strokes only exercises
-   peel-off using bow rudder to recover after crossing the jet
-   s-turns using bow rudder and only forward strokes
-   attainment in current
-   verbalization while performing

### Day 2 Pubnico, Sluice bridge

Flooding:

-   1-2-3 formation pods (mixed-grade class model)
    -   distributed awareness
    -   designated group leader
    -   easier to get info on exercises, if one exercise is missed due to say a rescue, you still have someone in your own group to ask
    -   ability to do rescues due to having more access to mixed skills
    -   mandated self-rescues
-   Exercises
    1.  Peel Outs
    2.  Paddle Paddle Paddle across the eddy line.
    3.  Ferry over and ferry back in.
    4.  Peel out and chase.
    5.  Peel out and contact tow.
    6.  Capsize then active swim back to the eddy.

Observations:

-   try to open the eyes during roll
-   when failing a roll multiple times, look for rescuer as "hand of god" or show hands for any alongside rescue
-   use wet-exit as last alternative!
