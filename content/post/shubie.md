### Shubenacadie River, from Maitland to Green Creek

Flooding:

First paddle of the season. There was no ice on the river. Still a lot of fresh water due to the melting snow. The strait still has ice, from the Confederation bridge you could see almost a 3rd part still covered in it.

It wasn't the biggest flow and there was no bore. We did not catch a lot of features and Chris's opinion was that we were too late for most. It was also very windy, perhaps gusting to 30 kts upstream. Overall it was a good day on the water, felt energized and was not overly tired at the end. I will put this on working the ergo.
